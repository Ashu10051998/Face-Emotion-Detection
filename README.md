# Face-Emotion-Detection
Facial expression for emotion detection has always been an easy task for humans, but achieving the same task with a computer algorithm is quite challenging. With the recent advancement in computer vision and machine learning, it is possible to detect emotions from images.In this project,we propose a novel technique called facial emotion recognition using convolutional neural networks,python and flask. Facial expressions are the vital identifiers for human feelings, because it corresponds to the emotions. Most of the times (roughly in 55% cases), the facial expression is a nonverbal way of emotional expression, and it can be considered as concrete evidence to uncover whether an individual is speaking the truth or not.
